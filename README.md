-🚀 Hi there! I'm Ian Banzi Álvarez — a tech enthusiast who loves turning code into cool things!

🎓 I'm a Computer Science and IT Junior from CETI Colomos (class of 2025), passionate about blending software and hardware to build smart, efficient, and sometimes quirky tech solutions.

I speak fluent C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and even microcontroller assembly (yes, I talk to the bits too). Whether it’s developing Android apps, writing embedded firmware for Arduino & ESP32, or making servers talk to databases — I’m in!

I'm also into electronics and circuit design, and I’m always hunting for ways to automate things and make life easier (Firebase are in my toolbox too).

I'm a big fan of clean, understandable and documented code — because great code should be easy to understand to anyone!

Bilingual (EN/ES), with curiosity as my compass and GitHub as my playground.
Let’s build something awesome!
