-🚀 Hi there! I'm Ian Banzi Álvarez — a tech enthusiast who loves turning code into cool things!

🎓 I'm a Computer Science and IT technologist from CETI Colomos (class of 2025), passionate about blending software and hardware to build smart, efficient, and sometimes quirky tech solutions.

💻 I speak fluent C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and even microcontroller assembly (yes, I talk to the bits too). Whether it’s developing Android apps, writing embedded firmware for Arduino & ESP32, or making servers talk to databases — I’m in!

📡 I also enjoy diving into networking, server setups, and circuit design, and I’m always hunting for ways to automate things and make life easier (Power BI and Firebase are in my toolbox too).

📂 I'm a big fan of clean code, teamwork, and well-documented projects — because great code should be easy to understand and fun to build together!

🌐 Bilingual (EN/ES), with curiosity as my compass and GitHub as my playground.
Let’s build something awesome!
